bypass new cs2 patch (snap tap update), credit to: [ruby rain](https://steamcommunity.com/id/r_by/)

# instructions
Just clone the repo and move the movement folder to the `<Counter Strike path>/game/csgo/cfg/`. Add `exec movement/setup` to your autoexec (alternatively use the autoexec provided in the repo, which has other interesting features). Enjoy.
