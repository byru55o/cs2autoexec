# cs2movement
bypass new cs2 patch (snap tap update), credit to: [ruby rain](https://steamcommunity.com/id/r_by/)

# instructions
Just clone the repo and move the movement folder to the `<Counter Strike path>/game/csgo/cfg/`. Add `exec movement/setup` to your autoexec (alternatively use the autoexec provided in the repo, which has other interesting features). Enjoy.

# autostop
The autoexec has a feature called autostop, it is basically automatic counterstrafe. It uses aliases and the comand leftright to stop instantly after you stop pressing a key. This is the only thing that should have been banned in the snap tap update, but somehow they managed to remove all the desubticks and multiple command binds such as jumpthrows and leave this "leftright" and "forwardback" commands in the game.
